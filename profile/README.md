# 🧩 Blueprint Platform — Architecture as a Product

> Architecture should not be *explained* — it should be *observable, versioned, and executable*.

**Blueprint Platform** is an architecture-first ecosystem designed to help engineering teams turn **architectural intent** into **explicit contracts** and **executable guardrails** — and keep them intact as systems, teams, and time evolve.

Blueprint does not rely on discipline, tribal knowledge, or best-effort reviews.
It makes architecture **explicit, testable, versioned**, and **enforced through engines and tooling**.

## ✅ Start here

**Active today**
- 🚀 **Engine (executable proof):** [`codegen-blueprint`](https://github.com/blueprint-platform/codegen-blueprint)  
  Architecture-first project generation + build-time guardrails proof (`mvn verify`) for Spring Boot.

**Planned / evolving**
- 📜 **Platform specs (contracts & governance):** *(planned repo / space)*  
  The canonical definitions that outlive any single engine.
- 📦 **Capabilities (versioned libraries):** *(planned)*  
  Security / observability / resilience delivered as centrally versioned libraries (not generated boilerplate).

## 🎯 What Blueprint Platform Enables

Blueprint Platform helps teams:

* 🚀 Start **production-oriented projects** from day zero
* 🧱 Keep architecture **consistent** as systems and teams grow
* 🧩 Make architectural boundaries **explicit and reviewable**
* 🔒 Apply **opt-in executable guardrails** instead of relying on conventions
* ♻️ Reuse enterprise behavior **without copy-pasting boilerplate**

Blueprint is **not** a template collection.
It is **architecture as a product** — versioned, observable, and made executable through engines that evaluate intent deterministically.

## 📦 Modules — One Platform, Multiple Responsibilities

Blueprint Platform is intentionally **multi-module**.
Each module is independently valuable, but designed to reinforce the others.

| Module / Space             | Status     | Responsibility                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform specs (contracts) | 🚧 Planned | Definitions, terminology, compatibility, governance            |
| `codegen-blueprint`        | 🚀 Active  | Architecture-first generation + executable guardrails proof    |
| Capabilities (libraries)   | 🚧 Planned | Versioned cross-cutting behavior (security/obs/resilience)     |
| Developer Portal           | ⚙️ Future  | Configure, generate, and govern architecture at scale          |

> 📌 Important distinction  
> `codegen-blueprint` is an **engine** (executable proof).  
> Contracts and capabilities live at the **platform level**.

## 🧠 Vision — From Guidelines to Guarantees

Architecture should not live in:

* Diagrams that drift
* Wiki pages no one enforces
* Code reviews that depend on heroics

Blueprint Platform makes architecture:

* ✔ **Explicit** — declared, not implied
* ✔ **Observable** — visible in artifacts and feedback
* ✔ **Executable** — evaluated deterministically by engines/tooling
* ✔ **Evolvable** — upgraded safely through versioned contracts

---

## 🌱 How the Platform Evolves

Blueprint Platform evolves in **intentional layers**:

1. **Architecture-aware generation**
2. **Executable guardrails (deterministic feedback)**
3. **Reusable capabilities (libraries, centrally versioned)**
4. **Governance at scale (profiles, policies, org-wide contracts)**
